    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="education-details about-text">
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Leela Mukherjee, and as a Silicon Valley native and a Computer Engineering Major at the University of Michigan, I have developed a deep interest in computer systems and hardware design. I have gone out of my way to seek out interesting experiences and projects to explore different aspects of hardware and to develop a more advanced skill set.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked on hardware design in unique environments, such as launchpads in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and microelectronic fabs in San Jose, California. I have assumed leadership, such as my role as Engineering Director for the University of Michigan Solar Car Team, to become more familiar with engineering project management and to get a top-down view of product development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have always been comfortable working in engineering labs though, and I have developed tools for companies and finished projects for my classes by tinkering with prototype boards and bench testing devices. I would love to work on the next great engineering project (I am currently looking for full-time positions starting January 2026!), and I hope my past experiences and current interests demonstrate this passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, you can find me hiking, traveling, or trying out a new craft. Please feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or by email â€” I would love to hear from you!
      </p>
